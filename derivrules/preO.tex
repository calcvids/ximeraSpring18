Here are the main points that are addressed in the video. Please read these and think about them as you watch.


\begin{itemize}
\item The derivative of a constant function $f(x)=c$ is $f'(x)=0$
\item The derivative of a monomial function $f(x)=ax^b$ (where $a$ and $b$ are numbers) is $f'(x)=b*ax^{b-1}$
\item The derivative of an exponential function $f(x)=a^x$ (where $a$ is a number) is $f'(x)=\ln(a)*a^x$
\item The derivative of a logarithmic function $f(x)=\log_a(x)$ is $f'(x)=\frac{1}{\ln(a)} \frac{1}{x}$
\end{itemize}
