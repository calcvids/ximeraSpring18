Here are the main points that are addressed in the video. Please read these and think about them as you watch.


\begin{itemize}
\item The derivative function $f'(x)$ shows you the slope of the tangent line to $f(x)$ at each value of $x$
\item If $f(x)$ is increasing, $f'(x)$ has positive values; if $f(x)$ is decreasing, $f'(x)$ has negative values
\item If $f(x)$ is concave up, then the slope of tangent lines to $f(x)$ increase as $x$ increases; thus, $f'(x)$ will be increasing
\end{itemize}
