\begin{problem}
A SUV monitors its fuel consumption as it starts to drive along a hilly highway. The SUV’s internal computer records the level of fuel in its tank and its odometer readings periodically, shown in the table below:
\begin{table}[h!]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{ll}
\hline
Fuel Level (gallons) & Distance (miles) \\
9.7                  & 2                \\
9.6                  & 5                \\
9.5                  & 8                \\
9.3                  & 12               \\
8.9                  & 14               \\
8.6                  & 16               \\
8.4                  & 18               \\
8.3                  & 21               \\
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

Compute an underestimate of the SUV’s fuel economy when there are 8.9 gallons of fuel in its tank, assuming that the rate of fuel consumption is either constantly increasing or constantly decreasing.
$\answer{5}$ miles per gallon
