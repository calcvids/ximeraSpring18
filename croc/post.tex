\begin{problem}
\item Suppose Jason is sailing his boat straight across a lake at a constant rate of 0.12 meters/second.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Let $\Delta t$ represent a change in the number of seconds elapsed during some part of Jasonâ€™s ride and let $\Delta d$ represent the corresponding change in the number of meters Jason traveled. Write an equation that expresses the relationship between $\Delta t$ and $\Delta d$. (If you use a decimal approximation, include at least 2 decimal places. You may also enter your answer unsimplified, like 1+2.)

$\Delta t = \answer{1/0.12} \times \Delta d$

\item Jason passes an island while traveling at this constant rate. At 10:30 AM, Jason is 3 meters past the island. At what time did Jason pass the island? (Fill in the hour in the first block and the minutes in the second block.)

Suppose $x$ and $y$ represent the measures of two quantities and $y$ changes at a constant rate of $-0.9$ with respect to $x$. As $x$ changes from 7 to 9.5, how much does $y$ change?
