Here are the main points that are addressed in the video. Please read these and think about them as you watch.

\begin{itemize}
\item These videos focus on the concept of constant rate of change between two variables.
\item A constant rate of change between $x$ and $y$ means that, for any fixed amount of change $\Delta x$, the corresponding amounts of change $\Delta y$ are constant.
\item If $x$ and $y$ represent the measures of two quantities, and $y$ varies at a constant rate of $\dfrac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}$ with respect to x, then the change in y is always $\dfrac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}$ as much as the corresponding change in $x$.
\end{itemize}
