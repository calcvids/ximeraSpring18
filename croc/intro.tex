\begin{problem}
Suppose Kim is riding her bike along a straight road at a constant rate of 0.56 km/min. Kim passes a coffee shop while traveling at this constant rate. At 9:30 AM, Kim is 3 km past the coffee shop. How far is Kim from the coffee shop at 9:54.6 (i.e., 24.6 minutes past 9:30 AM)? (If you use a decimal approximation, include at least 2 decimal places. You may also enter your answer unsimplified, like 1+2.)
