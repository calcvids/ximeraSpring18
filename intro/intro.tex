Welcome to Ximera. On this site, you'll watch and response to calculus videos on this site.

Each set of videos will include an introduction page to get you thinking about the content, then the videos themselves, and a follow-up page.

Also - please note that if a page has been updated, you will see an orange glowing ``update'' button in the top right corner of the screen.
